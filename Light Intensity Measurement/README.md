# ðŸŒž Light Intensity Measurement with Arduino

This project demonstrates how to measure ambient light using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and an Arduino, and dynamically adjust the brightness of an LED based on the light level. Real-time sensor data is displayed through the Serial Monitor.

## ðŸ”§ Circuit Description

The LDR and a 10kÎ© resistor form a **voltage divider**. The Arduino reads the analog voltage at pin **A5**, which varies based on light intensity. This value is mapped to PWM output and used to adjust the brightness of an LED connected to **pin 9**.
