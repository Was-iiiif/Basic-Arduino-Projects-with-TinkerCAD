# ðŸ¤– Smart Hand Sanitizer Dispenser using Arduino

This project is a contactless hand sanitizer dispenser built with an Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor. It detects your hand under the sanitizer nozzle and automatically presses the pump using a servo â€” perfect for hygiene in public or home spaces.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The **ultrasonic sensor** continuously measures the distance below the nozzle.
2. If a hand is detected within **10 cm**, the **servo rotates to press the sanitizer pump**.
3. After dispensing, the servo returns to its original position.
4. A cooldown delay ensures it doesnâ€™t trigger multiple times rapidly.
