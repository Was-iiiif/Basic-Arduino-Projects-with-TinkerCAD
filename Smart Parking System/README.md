# üöó Smart Parking System

This project demonstrates an **automated smart parking system** using an Arduino Uno. It detects the presence of vehicles in parking slots and controls entry and exit gates using servo motors. The parking status is displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen in real-time.

## üìã Features

- Detects vehicle presence in parking slots using IR sensors.
- Displays parking slot availability on an LCD display.
- Automatically controls entry and exit gates with servo motors.
- Simple, efficient, and cost-effective solution.
- Real-time status updates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

### 1. Slot Monitoring
- **IR Sensors on Pin 9 and 10** detect car presence in Slot 1 and Slot 2.
- If a slot is occupied, the LCD shows:
  
  `Slot 1 = NA` or `Slot 2 = NA`  *(NA: Not Available)*

- If a slot is vacant, the LCD shows:
  
  `Slot 1 = A` or `Slot 2 = A` *(A: Available)*

### 2. Gate Control
- **IR_ENTRY (Pin 8):** Detects cars approaching the entry gate. The entry servo opens to allow entry.
- **IR_EXIT (Pin 11):** Detects cars at the exit gate. The exit servo opens to allow departure.
- Gates return to the closed position when no car is detected.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Instructions

1. Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino Uno.
2. Power the Arduino with USB or external 5V power supply.
3. The LCD will display a welcome message and initial slot status.
4. Place an object in front of the IR sensors to simulate a vehicle.
5. Watch the slot availability change on the LCD and the gates operate automatically.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Replace IR sensors with ultrasonic sensors for more precise detection.
- Increase the number of monitored slots.
- Add network connectivity for remote monitoring (using ESP32 or Wi-Fi module).
- Integrate with a smartphone app or web dashboard.
- Include automatic billing or ticketing.
