# ðŸ“¸ Interfacing Photodiode

This project demonstrates how to use a **photodiode** with an Arduino UNO to detect ambient light intensity. The sensor reads analog voltage changes based on light exposure and displays the values in the Serial Monitor.

## ðŸ“· Project Overview

A **photodiode** is a semiconductor device that generates a voltage or current when exposed to light. In this project, the photodiode is connected in a **voltage divider** configuration with a resistor. The Arduino reads the analog voltage at the junction and interprets the light level.

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Diagram

- The photodiode is used in a reverse-biased configuration with a resistor to form a voltage divider.
- One end of the photodiode is connected to **5V**
- The other end is connected to:
- Analog pin **A0**
- One end of a **10kÎ© resistor**, whose other end is connected to **GND**

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- In bright light, the photodiode allows more current to pass.
- This changes the voltage at the analog pin.
- The Arduino reads this voltage (0â€“5V) as an integer (0â€“1023).
- The Serial Monitor displays the corresponding value in real time.

## ðŸ§  Applications
- Light-based security systems
- Optical communication
- Infrared detection
- Object sensing and counters
