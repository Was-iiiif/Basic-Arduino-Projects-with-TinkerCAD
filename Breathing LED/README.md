# üå¨Ô∏è Breathing LED 

This Arduino project simulates the natural rhythm of human breathing by gradually increasing and decreasing the brightness of an LED ‚Äî mimicking the "inhale" and "exhale" pattern. It's a calming light effect suitable for meditation aids, night lights, or aesthetic installations.

## üß† Breathing Pattern Logic

| Phase     | Duration (ms) | Description                     |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------------|
| Inhale    | 2000           | LED gradually gets brighter     |
| Hold      | 500            | LED stays at max brightness     |
| Exhale    | 3000           | LED gradually dims              |
| Pause     | 500            | LED remains off (optional)      |

Total breathing cycle ‚âà **6 seconds**, mimicking calm human breathing (~10 BPM).
