# ðŸš¨ Motion-Controlled RGB LED Siren using Arduino

This project is a motion-activated RGB lighting system with a high-frequency siren sound using an Arduino, a PIR motion sensor, a piezo buzzer, and RGB LEDs.

When motion is detected:
- A **siren sound** plays through the buzzer.
- All RGB LEDs turn **blue**.
- When idle, RGB LEDs glow **purple**.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **PIR detects motion** â†’ Digital HIGH on pin 2.
2. Triggers `sirenEffect()` â†’ A sweeping frequency sound.
3. RGB LEDs display a **blue alert** color.
4. When **no motion** â†’ LEDs revert to **purple**.
